I am a master student at UC Davis in the Statistics department. Before this I was an undergraduate student at Xi'an Jiao Tong University in the Mathematics and Statistics Department. I hold a Bachelor degree in Mathematics from Xi'an Jiao Tong University. I do not have specific researches now but I feel machine learning is interesting. 
I am from China and my hometwon is Xi'an. It is a city with rich culture and many historical sites.  is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the [Terracotta Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army) of [Emperor Qin Shi Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang).
